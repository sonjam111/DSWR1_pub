This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. 

##Features of R markdown notebooks

An R markdown notebook has the following characteristics

* Reproducible workflow by default.

* Code, output and narrative in a single document.

* Output to multiple formats (html, PDF, Word).

* Output inline with code: When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

* It is possible to share output and code in a single file.

##R Markdown notebook file formats

* The notebook source code is a .Rmd file

* Notebooks have an associated HTML file (.nb.html). It is created automatically when the .Rmd is saved.
When you save a notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

* The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.



##Executing R code

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

```{r}
help(cars)
```

```{r}
#print the names of the data frame cars
names(cars)
```

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

##`starwars` data frame

```{r}
#the data frame starwars is in the package dplyr. We load it
library(dplyr)
#print the data frame
starwars
```

```{r}
#extract names of female characters in base R
names.f = starwars$name[starwars$gender == "female" & is.na(starwars$gender) == "FALSE"]
names.f
```

```{r}
#Each entry of the column films is a list
#Films where Luke Skywalker appears as a character
starwars$films[1]
```


```{r}
# It's easier to use "filter" from the package dplyr
filter(starwars, hair_color == "none" & eye_color == "black")
```

```{r}
# Multiple arguments are equivalent to and
filter(starwars, hair_color == "none", eye_color == "black")
```


```{r}
filter(starwars, hair_color == "none" | eye_color == "black")
```

##Something fancier

```{r}
library(dygraphs)
dygraph(nhtemp, main = "New Haven Temperatures") %>% 
  dyRangeSelector(dateWindow = c("1920-01-01", "1960-01-01"))
```
