This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. 

##Features of R markdown notebooks

An R markdown notebook has the following characteristics

* Reproducible workflow by default.

* Code, output and narrative in a single document.

* Output to multiple formats (html, PDF, Word).

* Output inline with code: When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

* It is possible to share output and code in a single file.

##R Markdown notebook file formats

* The notebook source code is a .Rmd file

* Notebooks have an associated HTML file (.nb.html). It is created automatically when the .Rmd is saved.
When you save a notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

* The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.



##Executing R code

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk ( the "play" button, green triangle) or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.



```{r}
help(cars)
```

```{r}
#print the names of the columns of the data frame cars
names(cars)
```

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

##`starwars` data

```{r}
#the data frame `starwars` is part of the package `dplyr`. We load the package
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
#print the data frame
starwars
```

There are two basic actions that are crucial when dealing with data frames (tibbles in this case): selecting row and columns.

In `dplyr` the function `select()` is used to choose columns. The function `filter()` is used to choose rows.



```{r}
#extract names of female characters in base R
names_f_base <- starwars$name[starwars$gender == "female"]
names_f_base
```
 
 As can be seen in the output there are some missing values.

```{r}
#extract names of female characters and exclude the missing values
names_f_base <- starwars$name[starwars$gender == "female" & is.na(starwars$gender) == "FALSE"]
names_f_base
```

Using `dplyr` the syntax becomes more meaningful. 

```{r}
aux <- filter(starwars, gender == "female")
names_f <- select(aux, name)
names_f
```

The same but now we use the piping operator `%>%` which has the effect of making the output to its left an input to its right.

```{r}
names_f <- starwars %>% filter(gender == 'female') %>% select(name)
names_f
```





```{r}
#extracting the number of characters by eye colour
summary(as.factor(starwars$eye_color))
```

The function `table()` also works

```{r}
#extracting the number of characters by eye colour
table(as.factor(starwars$eye_color))
```


Equivalently, we can use `dplyr` functions and the piping operator to save us some typing and more meaningful syntax.

```{r}
starwars %>% group_by(eye_color) %>% summarise(nr_char = n())
```

Without the piping operator, in order to obtain the same output:

```{r}
aux <- group_by(starwars, eye_color)
summarise(aux, nr_char = n())
```

```{r}
#Each entry of the column films is a list
#Films where Luke Skywalker appears as a character
starwars$films[1]
```
Suppose I would like to extract the rows in `starwars` corresponding to characters with no hair colour and black eyes.


In `dplyr` one can use the `filter()` function and this results is more meaningful syntax

```{r}
# It's easier to use "filter" from the package dplyr
filter(starwars, hair_color == "none" & eye_color == "black")
```

Equivalently,

```{r}
# Multiple arguments separated by commas are equivalent to logical "and""
filter(starwars, hair_color == "none", eye_color == "black")
```

Characters who have either no hair colour or black eyes

```{r}
filter(starwars, hair_color == "none" | eye_color == "black")
```


##**EXERCISE**: extract the names of characters taller than Anakin Skywalker


(don't scroll down! Solution is below)

























###In base R:
```{r}
ash <- starwars$height[starwars$name == "Anakin Skywalker"]
ash
```
Anakin Skywalker is tall!

But there are many characters taller than Anakin
```{r}
starwars$name[starwars$height > ash]
```

###Using `dplyr`:
```{r}
ash2 <- starwars %>% filter(name == "Anakin Skywalker") %>% select(height) %>% as.numeric()
starwars %>% filter(height > ash2) %>% select(name)
```




##Something fancier

```{r}
library(dygraphs)#you need to install the package first
dygraph(nhtemp, main = "New Haven Temperatures") %>% 
  dyRangeSelector(dateWindow = c("1920-01-01", "1960-01-01"))
```
